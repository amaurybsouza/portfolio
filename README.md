Hi, I'm Amaury! An experienced {Lead/DevOps Engineer} with over 10 years, of experience in designing, implementing, and managing scalable and robust infrastructure solutions. My expertise includes working with a variety of DevOps tools, cloud platforms, and automation technologies to streamline development workflows and accelerate application delivery. I'm always eager to learn about new technologies and I've worked for companies like **Kyndryl**, **IBM**, **TechFor**, **Tecnoset**, **NTL** and more. I studied Systems Analysis at Fatec Americana!
