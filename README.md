## Professional Career
Over 11yoe, I've built a strong track record in Linux, Cloud Security & DevSecOps, driving impactful contributions at leading banks (SunTrust, Bradesco) and consulting firms (CI&T, IBM, Kyndryl, etc.). As a Cloud Security Architect, I leverage automation and emerging technologies like AI to continuously enhance security posture. My passion for knowledge sharing extends beyond my work: I curate a DevSecOps newsletter at [Substack](https://amauryborgessouza.substack.com/), I love writing tech posts at [Medium](https://amaurybsouza.medium.com/), and actively contribute to open-source communities ([AWS User Group Campinas](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/awscampinas/), [HashiCorp User Group Campinas](https://www.meetup.com/campinas-hashicorp-user-group/), [Hackerspaces](https://lhc.net.br/w/index.php?title=P%C3%A1gina_principal), [DoDs](https://devopsdays.org/)). 

I have recognized for my [expertise](https://www.credly.com/users/amaury-souza.725c7326), I've achieved certifications in AWS, Azure, & Terraform. Additionally, my post-graduate degree in [Solutions Architecture](https://www.pucminas.br/Pos-Graduacao/IEC/Cursos/Paginas/ArquiteturadeSolucoes_EAD_Especializacao%20e%20Master.aspx?pageID=5286&moda=5&polo=43&curso=1140&situ=1) provides a solid foundation for designing and implementing scalable and secure cloud solutions. My ability to adapt to new technologies and industry trends, combined with my strong communication learned with community, and problem-solving skills, allows me to deliver exceptional results in cloud security. Over the past months, I've spearheaded initiatives to create and share knowledge around cloud technologies and HashiCorp products.
